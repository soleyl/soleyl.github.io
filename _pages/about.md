Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:

> Hi there! I'm a software specialist by day, aspiring baker by night, and this is my website. I live in ReykjavÃ­k, have 15 plants, and I like rum. (And swimming in the Atlantic Ocean).


How about linking/adding my CV to this about page!?
